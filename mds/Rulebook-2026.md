ASSALAMU ALAIKUM,
peace be upon you

Every project you craft this year begins with a single small step. A simple idea, a
moment of inspiration, or a quiet intention can grow into something meaningful. In
MIST, the most impactful creations often start with these small beginnings, shaped by
your sincerity and effort.

As you prepare for your competitions, think about the small choices that influence your
work: the extra revision you decide to make, the detail you refine, the concept you
explore a little deeper. These seemingly minor decisions are what transform an ordinary
submission into something thoughtful and powerful. Ask yourself: What values guide
the things I create? How does intention elevate my work? How can small improvements
done consistently bring out the best in my craft?

Remember that excellence is not about perfection, but about purposeful steps taken
with sincerity. Every choice you make, from how you prepare to how you collaborate
and how you present yourself, shapes not only your own growth but the overall spirit of
this tournament. How will you use your small deeds to foster creativity, character, and
community?

Bismillah (In the Name of Allah). We enter this tournament season striving for sincerity,
consistency, and the awareness that even the smallest deeds can carry great value.
May Allah accept our efforts and allow us to create with clarity and purpose. Ameen.

Sincerely,
Hira Khattak
National Competitions Director

CURRENTS OF CONSEQUENCE
The Might of Small Deeds
The butterfly effect reminds us that the smallest actions, good or bad, can set off vast chains of events. A
single word, a habit, or a choice that seems insignificant in the moment can ripple outward, shaping people, communities, and even history. Those ripples may flow gently in streams, or surge forward as floods,
their final impact unknown. Yet over time, streams cut valleys, rivers carve canyons, and tides reshape
entire coastlines. Do our actions have the same effect?

The immense power of a seemingly small act is illustrated in the story of Prophet Musa (peace be upon
him) in Surah al-Qasas. His mother’s decision to trust in God and cast her infant into the Nile became
the tide that turned a tyrant. One small ripple set into motion Musa’s upbringing in the Pharaoh's palace,
preparing him to one day stand against oppression with truth and conviction.

Just as one decision can lead to unexpected good, the principle of action and consequence also means
that negative acts can result in a cascade of devastating effects. Abu Huraira reported that the Prophet
Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) said, “Verily, when the servant commits a sin, a black
mark appears upon his heart. If he abandons the sin, seeks forgiveness, and repents, then his heart will
be polished. If he returns to the sin, the blackness will be increased until it overcomes his heart” (Tirmidhī
3334). Careless actions, hurtful words, wasted time, and neglected responsibilities can unearth dangerous sinkholes, but repentance offers a path to pull oneself out.

In today’s world of instant gratification, small deeds may feel insignificant, and change may feel too slow.
But Islam teaches that transformation is built on consistency, patience, and trust in Al Wakeel, the trustee
and disposer of affairs. Surah al-Hud tells how Prophet Nuh (peace be upon him) built his ark while people
mocked him. Although each plank hammered seemed meaningless to others, when devastating floods
came, those small steps became salvation for humanity. Every prayer, every act of kindness, every contribution to justice is a drop in an ocean of barakah, blessings that endure and multiply over time.

The choices you make today may become the tide someone else rides tomorrow. Alternatively, you may
be stationed at the center or end of a wave set off by others’ actions. What ripple will you create? How
do you ensure your actions contribute to positive growth? How do you take accountability for your role in
a chain of events, when the outcome is positive, and when it is negative?

We encourage you to creatively explore these concepts and more in Regional and National competitions
and workshops during MIST 2026. Remember that unique projects displaying creativity and insight will
be judged most favorably.

## DEBATE
Format: In-Person

Registration Guidelines:
1. A maximum of two (2) students from each team may register for this competition, with no substitutions.
2. This competition is a team effort, but students are also permitted to register solo. If solo, students must fill both roles
for their team.
MIST Parliamentary Debates attempt to transform detailed discussions that occur in the House of Commons to a
format that teaches principles of reasoning, argument, and quick wit. In addition, the Resolutions (i.e. debate topics) of
Parliamentary Debates must be a question of policy (ex. Capital punishment is an effective deterrent to murder).

Note: Parliamentary Debate is a Bracket Competition, which stipulates that it is an elimination competition. There are:
- Two rounds of Preliminaries
- One Quarterfinal Round (top 8 teams)
- One Semifinal Round (top 4 teams) and one Final Round.

In the event that an odd number of teams are present at the very first preliminary round of the Parliamentary Debate
Tournament, even-numbered pairs will be made, with a randomized odd team sitting out the first preliminary and
competing in the 2nd preliminary round.]
All teams regardless of round results advance to Round 2 of preliminaries.

Debate will follow a win versus loss structure as opposed to being points based.
For students with the same win-loss ratio, the following steps will be taken to break ties for seeding in brackets:
1. An "opponent strength" score will be tallied to prevent easy schedule biases. Further ties will be taken to the judges
to determine who moves on to the quarterfinal round.
a. Opponent strength will be measured by the win-loss ratios of the team’s opponents. This is meant to balance
based on schedule biases in preliminary rounds.
b. For example: if a team with a 1-1 loss ratio wins against a team that has 0 wins, they would rank lower than a
1-1 team.
2. Judges will rank speakers on teams in terms of speaking ability (rankings go from 1-4)
a. This will place teams with better speakers for their arguments higher.
b. For teams with only one competitor, this tiebreaker is used for roles (one person will be treated under two
separate roles for their performance).
c.   Please write ranks next to MIST IDs in the Debate Ballot.
Procedure:
1. The total scores from each preliminary round will be calculated and the 8 teams with the best records will proceed to
the next round.
2. The moderator of a Parliamentary debate is called the “Speaker” and all debaters must address themselves to “Mr.
[or Madam] Speaker” at the outset of their speeches.
a. The affirmative side is called the “Government” while the “Opposition” represents the negative.
b. Participants in the debate and members of the audience are referred to collectively as the “House” while the
resolution is simply termed the “Bill”.
c.   Debaters must always refer to one another in the third person (for example, “the Prime Minister”, “Leader of the
Opposition”). They must not call other debaters by their real names.
3. Members will speak only when called upon by the Speaker or when allowed a "Point of Information."

4. Debaters shall not use profane or offensive language.
5. No forms of AI are permitted to prep for this competition. Any usage is grounds for point loss and/or disqualification.
6. During the final rebuttal speeches presented by the Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister, debaters may
not bring up any new arguments or new evidence except in direct refutation of material which has already been
presented.
7. Competitors are allowed to bring in notes and outlines on the Resolution and may refer to them at any point during
the debate. Electronic device usage is not permitted during the competition.
a. If needed, competitors will be provided with scrap paper for tracking their opponent’s arguments.
8. Competitors will not be permitted to view completed ballots at any point during the tournament, only at its conclusion.
9. In the event of less than 8 teams being present for preliminaries, the top 6 will proceed to quarterfinals.
10. Parliamentary Debate topics will be announced in a random order and are available at www.getmistified.com/
rulebook.

LO (6 minutes)
Constructive Speech:
- The LO presents a new independent argument relating to the case. Outlines why the government case is flawed/
wrong.
- Refutes the government case, explaining why the solution won’t work or why the problem does not actually exist.

CM (6 minutes)
Constructive Speech:
- Brings forth additional one or two arguments supporting the government.
- The CM rebuilds the Government position and the original points introduced by the PM.
CM Rebuttal:
- Goes through the points presented by the LO and rebuts them.

- Brings forth the bulk of the opposition arguments, introducing 3 or 4 points.
- The MO rebuilds the Opposition position and reconstructs the points introduced by the LO.
Rebuttal:
- Introduces new Opposition rebuttal points (specific additional reasons raised by the Opposition for why the
Government case is wrong).
- The LO may also pose questions to the Government. Questions may be asked for clarification, or meant to corner
opponents (not rhetorical).
- Government may not ask questions during this section, and may freely choose to answer or refuse to answer
specific questions.
PM Rebuttal (3 minutes):
- Rebuild critical aspects of Government case and sum up entire debate by showing why the Government has won
the debate.
- No new evidence or arguments may be presented here.

LO Rebuttal (final 3 minutes):
Offers a rebuttal to the Government, summarizes the Opposition side and restates the Opposition points.
No new evidence or arguments may be presented here.

Special Feature – Points of Information
- Points of Information (POIs) are a unique feature of Parliamentary Debates.
- POIs are opportunities for debaters to rise during the opposition’s speeches and offer a question or comment.
- To receive permission to present a POI, a debater must say “Point of Information” and place one hand on his/her
head with one hand held out palm up.
- The speaker then knows the debater is interested in stealing the floor and may decline this request by waving the
individual down or saying “No thank you”.
- The POI can be used to clarify something or point out a flaw or contradiction in the speaker’s argument or make a
comment that will link to something the opposition will discuss later. POIs must be kept very brief and to the point
(5-10 seconds).
- Only 2 POIs can be offered during any speech.
- POIs cannot be offered during the first and last minute of constructive speeches. No POIs may be offered during
the last two speeches.
- The entire final LO and PM rebuttals are protected and POIs cannot be offered during this time.

The Speaker
- The Speaker acts as the timekeeper and introduces each debater before speaking.
- Before beginning, the Speaker will write the exact resolution and the names of debaters in their speaking order on
a blackboard clearly visible to all judges.
- The Speaker will also flip a coin to determine which team will represent the Government and which will represent
the Opposition.

1. After the Prime Minister’s Speech, the speaker shall say: “I thank the Prime Minister for his/her remarks. We shall now
hear the Leader of Opposition.”
2. After the Leader of Opposition Speech, the speaker shall say: “Thank you for your remarks. I now call upon the Crown
Minister to deliver his/her speech.”
3. After the Crown Minister's Speech, the speaker shall say: “Thank you. A speaker for the Opposition will now deliver a
speech opposing the Bill.”
4. After the Member of the Opposition’s speech, the speaker shall say: “I thank the member of the Opposition, and now
call upon the Prime Minister to present the Government’s final rebuttal. During this final rebuttal, no new arguments
may be made.”
5. After the Prime Minister's Speech, the speaker shall say: “Thank you. The Leader of the Opposition will now deliver
the last speech opposing the Bill.”
6. Finally, the speaker shall say: “On behalf of the House, I thank the Judges for their assistance; I congratulate all the
debaters on their performances; and I thank the members of the House for their attentiveness. Since this debate is
now concluded and there is no other business on the Order Paper, the House stands adjourned.”

Judging Criteria
1. Organization: The speech should be well structured, logical & coherent, containing an effective introduction and
conclusion.
2. Evidence/Logic: Facts, statistics & authorities offered in support of contentions must be sound.
3. Credit should be given for thorough and relevant research.
4. Delivery: Poise quality & use of voice, combined with emphasis, variety and enunciation.
5. Effectiveness and ease of gestures, and eye contact should be assessed.
6. Refutation/Clash: The ability to apply logic and evidence in refuting the opponents’ contentions while defending your
own.
7. Format: Does each debater demonstrate an understanding of parliamentary procedure & adhere to the rules of the
house? Are points of order & privilege appropriately used?

Note to Judges and Competitors:
1. Due to the structured and formal nature of Parliamentary Debates, judges and competitors are required to be careful
listeners, tracking each statement and argument, and weighing each piece of evidence.
2. Judges will be required to follow each team’s arguments very carefully, making special note of what they present,
how they respond to their opponents, and how effectively their statements and evidence drive home the arguments
that they are attempting to make.
3. The end goal of debate is ultimately to decide which of the teams presented the most compelling arguments and put
up the best defense against their opponents’ arguments, not only the quality of the delivery.
4. Judges will take all factors into account, and offer their grading on a holistic level, making sure never to allow
personal biases or predispositions concerning the debaters or the topics to impact their ruling.

Note to Organizers and Competitors:
1. Reminder: Only the top 4 teams from debate may qualify for the National Tournament.
2. Regions must hold a 3rd place match concurrently with the final match, so that the semi-finalists are guaranteed 2
matches each. With this addition, the third rank will be determined more fairly. (One finals match to determine first
and second place, and one third place match to determine third and fourth place).

Round One
The competition begins with the judges explaining the rules of Round 1 to the competitors. Round 1 will ALWAYS cover
only the topic of Current Events.
1. This round has a series of 10 toss up questions consisting of two parts.
2. If the question is answered in the first part and correct, the student will receive 100 points. However, if the answer is
incorrect, the team will lose 100 points.
3. If the answer is given in the second sentence prompting more clear information from the given packets, the student
will receive 50 points. However, if the answer is incorrect, the team will lose 50 points. Moderators will not pause
between parts of the question but students will be prompted at the half-point mark with “for 50 points."
4. Full points are given to the correct answer and full penalties are given regardless of how many teams have
answered the question.
5. Once buzzed in, judges must stop reading at the word and are not allowed to repeat the question.
6. If the question was answered incorrectly, the question may now be answered by the next team to buzz in for full
original point value, with a 10 second limit given on the response.

7. Teams can buzz in as soon as buzzers are reset or they can wait for the judge to read the question again.
8. All teams have an opportunity to answer the question before it is considered a dead question.
9. There is no "Done" rule for this entire round.
Example question for Round 1:
This question is modeled after the current events from 2022 and will not be used in tournament. The first part of the
question is from other resources from outside articles MIST would not provide (thus, encouraging competitors to read
about current events outside of provided information). The portion following "for 50 points" has information directly from
the 2022 Wikipedia page.
"This tournament’s mascot, Mola the lion, appeared throughout venues in cities such as Bafoussam, Garoua, and
Limbe, which hosted group-stage matches for this event. Despite multiple postponements due to infrastructure delays
and COVID-19 concerns, this competition ultimately proceeded under strict health protocols, including reduced stadium
capacities and mandatory PCR testing for all attendees. For 50 points: name this international football competition, held
from January 9 to February 6, 2021, in Cameroon, which Senegal won for the first time."
Answer: the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (accept AFCON 2021)

Round Two
1. This round follows with two categories of questions. The topics will be announced at the beginning of the round by
the judges.
2. All questions are in ascending point value from 20 to 140 with 20-point increments between each question.
Questions from the first randomized category will be for the first 7 questions from point values 20-140 and the
second set of 7 questions will be from the second randomized category also ranging from point values 20-140.
Round 2 categories are randomized in each game.
3. Judges will read the point-value of the question first and then proceed to read the question.
4. If a competitor believes that they can anticipate the answer of the question being read, they may buzz in early and
answer the question.
5. If the student interrupts the moderator to give an answer, the student should immediately give the answer.
6. The answering team must answer within 10 seconds of the buzz and finish answering the question in 10 seconds for
a 20-second total time. If incorrect, the question will be opened to the floor for all other teams.
7. Once buzzed in, judges must stop reading at the word and are not allowed to repeat the question for the currently
buzzed in team.
8. Teams can buzz in as soon as the judge announces a team's answer is wrong, or they can wait for the judge to read
the question again.
9. In this round, incorrect answers are penalized. For example, if a team were to respond incorrectly to a 100 point
question, then 10 points are deducted from their running total.
10. When the floor opens for other teams to steal the question, the question point values are halved. Using the example
from before, if a team stole a 100 point question, they would be awarded 50 in the case of a right answer and would
have 50 points deducted if they answered incorrectly.
11. Questions are considered dead after 2 incorrect answers. Therefore there are only full points and half points possible
for the first 2 teams to buzz in.

Round Three
1. Round 3 then follows in the same fashion as Round 2: incorrect answers are to be penalized.
2. Judges will mention which two categories are being represented in Round 3.
3. Just as with Round 2, questions are considered dead after 2 incorrect answers. Therefore there are only full points
and half points possible for the first 2 teams to buzz in.
