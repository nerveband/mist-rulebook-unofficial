Example question for new format Round 1:
This question is modeled after the current events from 2022 and will not be used
in the 2026 tournament. The first part of the question is from other resources from
outside articles MIST would not provide (thus, encouraging competitors to read about
current events outside of provided information). The portion following "for 50 points" has
information directly from the 2022 Wikipedia page.

"For 100 points: This tournament’s mascot, Mola the lion, appeared throughout venues
in cities such as Bafoussam, Garoua, and Limbe, which hosted group-stage matches for
this event. Despite multiple postponements due to infrastructure delays and COVID-19
concerns, this competition ultimately proceeded under strict health protocols, including
reduced stadium capacities and mandatory PCR testing for all attendees. For 50 points:
name this international football competition, held from January 9 to February 6, 2021, in
Cameroon, which Senegal won for the first time."

Answer: The 2021 Africa Cup of Nations (accept AFCON 2021)
