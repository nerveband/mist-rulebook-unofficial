Humanitarian Crisis The Sudan Story - UCSF Global Institute for Health Sciences
Salma Dali
So thank you all for joining today. Today we're talking about a quite heavy topic. It's the
humanitarian crisis, the Sudan story. I'm sure many of you here already know the situation that's
going on in Sudan. I'd really love to provide a little bit more context and information and just
have kind of an open discussion with you all. I am Salma. I'm a Pediatric Hospital Medicine
Fellow at UCSF in my first year, and I'm also a Sudanese American person.
Before we kind of jump in, I'd love to just take a moment for all of us to reflect and think
together, just to kind of enter us into this space. And I want people not specifically to think about
necessarily the situation in Sudan, but I want people to maybe just think about a time that you, a
family member, a friend, somebody in your life has been affected by civil unrest. I think for many
of us in the US, we can think about and call upon many examples from the recent past,
including a lot of things during the COVID pandemic. A lot of times with racial unrest. The Civil
Rights Movement and many, many other instances. So, I'd love people to just kind of reflect and
think about a time.
And then the other thing I would really love is. And people can just share. Either in the chat,
or if people are brave enough to maybe unmute, what brought you to this talk today? It looks
like one person said that they're here in this talk today because they're also from Sudan, so it's
great to see other Sudanese people here. Someone else's desire to “expand my understanding
and knowledge surrounding the current crisis, seeking awareness, wanting to know more about
what's happening.” And I'm really grateful to you all for wanting to learn more about the situation
and for joining me here today. I am here in the capacity of also wanting to learn more truthfully
alongside you all. As I said, I'm a pediatric hospital medicine fellow, and I come to this talk
because I am a Sudanese American.
That's my family. That's me, this tiny little baby. Not much has changed since then. And I
was actually born in Sudan and moved to the U. S. with my family. On political asylum when I

was four years old to escape the Bashir regime. Most of my family is still in Sudan and so I've
been quite heavily affected by this conflict. I feel like I've been really unable to watch the news.
I'm filled with really worry and wondering if they're safe. I really I feel a sense of kind of
hopelessness and helplessness. And I'm sure, like many of you can relate, I really just have a
desire to learn more and be able to do more. And I really am coming to this talk with a lot of
humility that I'm learning alongside people. I'm not a politician. I'm not a historian. I'm just a
person who cares deeply about my family and my community and my people in Sudan. And so,
I'm here just to share some more information with you all. And like I said, I'm not an expert, but I
hope to be able to kind of share some things about Sudan with you all through my lens.
And so, just to start, to kind of ground us in this. Many of you know that Sudan is one of the
largest countries in Africa, and it's really positioned kind of like in the central horn of Africa, right
here, on the Eastern part. In between the Middle East and Africa. And so, it serves as quite an
important location for trade and really has large impacts on the stability or instability of a much
broader country or a much broader region. And unfortunately, Sudan has been really plagued by
a tumultuous past with civil wars and genocide and most of the conflict that I think many people
are familiar with was the conflict in Darfur, or the genocide in Darfur, that stemmed from
variation in ethnic and religious groups. Som, the North being largely Arab Muslims. and the
South and many parts of the West being darker Africans or Christians or tribal religions. And so
that led to genocide, really, in Darfur that I think a lot of people are familiar with, that started in
2003 and was led by a large group called the Janjaweed, who are still committing war crimes in
this area. And we'll talk a little bit about that. And then, in 2005, actually, South Sudan was
recognized as an independent country. And even though these are the things that have
happened in the past and things that many people have since forgotten about or since have left
their memory, there's still ongoing violence and unrest in many parts of Sudan. And I think the
images that we’re flooded with in the news about Sudan are really always constantly images of
genocide, of war, of violence, of struggle, and of conflict. And I just want to share a different
perspective that that's not my memory of Sudan. That's not my view of Sudan. The things that I
think about when I think about Sudan are the love that I feel there. So, this is a picture of me
with my aunt and the Sudan I know really is filled with family and warmth. It's filled with kisses
from my aunt. Stand in the garden of our home, surrounded by lime trees and fragrant flowers.
And I remember many nights when I go back and visit, sleeping outside under the stars, and I
feel like I can still hear the sound of the birds chirping along with the sunrise or the sound of a

croaking rooster telling me it's time to wake up. The Sudan I know is filled with bustling markets
with their colorful spices pouring out onto the streets. Finding their way into homemade chai or
homemade rice-rich stews. It's filled with scorching summer days with my uncle. This is a
picture of us dipping our feet in the beautiful Nile River that runs along Sudan. And these really
are the images of Sudan that I hold on to, as these other images that have been occupying the
news start to kind of cloud my vision.
And so that brings us to kind of the current situation where I think we've seen that a lot of
the images have replaced bliss with sorrow.
The current conflict in Sudan started on April 15th when infighting broke out between two
groups. The military group, also called the Sudan Armed Forces, who were led by this man,
General al-Burhan, and a paramilitary group called the Rapid Support Forces, who are led by
this man, Hemedti. And really what's happening there is a power struggle between these two
groups, between these two men that lead these two groups ahead of a planned transition to a
civilian-led government. So, although there were hopes to transition eventually peacefully to a
civilian government, these two groups have since started fighting, and a lot of civilians have
been caught in the crossfire of airstrikes, of bombings, of shootings, and have really been used
in this war without any care for their lives.
Since the fighting broke out exactly a month ago, over 500 people have been killed. And
thousands more injured. And these numbers, unfortunately, are still rising. The airport has been
demolished, which has limited ability to for people to leave. It's also limited access to critical
resources in the country. Much of the country, of the people in the country, are really dependent
on humanitarian aid, and aid has not been able to get into the country. The beautiful markets
that I referenced just before… many have been burned down, leaving people without food. The
water has been shut off. Power has been shut off. People have been barricaded inside their
homes. And really in search of relatives around the area, have to take these perilous journeys to
find safer places to reside in the meantime. The power has been shut off. People don't have
access to running water. And beyond that, there have been many, many acts of gender-based
violence. People have been raped. The same people who've committed war crimes in Darfur
are committing the same acts of violence against young women and girls. And really, this
conflict has resulted in an already unstable situation where most of the population, up to 53% by
some sources, is acutely food insecure, plagued by many years of conflict and economic crisis,

and has led what's already been unstable, really propelled it into this humanitarian crisis that we
know and see today.
So how did we get here? I mentioned that there's been a really long historical background,
and I, again, I'm not a historian, so I won't plan to go into all of it. But I do want to kind of walk us
through a timeline focusing on four main areas, four main years that are important, 1989, 2019,
2021, and 2023.
So starting in 1989, Sudan actually hasn't been an independent country for that long. It
became independent in the 1950s. And in 1989, al-Bashir started his dictatorship. He came to
power through a military coup and proceeded to implement an Islamic state, wherein he
silenced people who were not Islamic and carried out acts of violence and many atrocities, and
is really largely responsible for what we know as the genocide in Darfur. Started by differences
in religion, differences in culture, and carried out many war crimes. In the meantime, he's been
charged by the International Criminal Court for some of these war crimes, but actually has not
really been held responsible for any of the crimes and atrocities that he's committed. He ran the
country ruthlessly for 30 long years until he was displaced in 2019. And during his time, there
were many attempts at uprisings, and he actually created the Rapid Support Forces as a
paramilitary group in an effort to silence any kind of uprisings that would happen, and he
appointed this general, Hemedti, who's one of the key figures right now responsible for the
infighting, as one of his main men, as number two in command, to be the one responsible for
shutting down any kind of uprisings in Darfur and in surrounding regions. Hemedti rose through
the ranks and really became, regarded by Al-Bashir, as a figurehead and somebody who would
go to any extent and any lengths to silence these protesters. And so, during Al-Bashir's time,
although the army already existed, this paramilitary group started to emerge, and that's
important because that sort of has created the structure that exists today.
Although many people thought that al-Bashir's reign, since it had already been going on for
the entirety of my life and the entirety of the life of many people who live in Sudan for over 30
years, many people thought al-Bashir’s power would only end when he died.
But the Sudanese people had other plans and other intentions. And in 2019, there was a
revolution and this revolution is really quite unique because it was led by young people. It was
led by women. This is one of the most common images of the revolution, and it shows this
young woman, also known as a kandaka, or a woman of the revolution. And they led this really
incredibly successful non-violent protest. Unilaterally non-violent, of course, the government did

enact forms of violence, but the protesters, regardless, felt that it was so important to have
democracy and to no longer tolerate this rule that they stood together. They came together, they
had massive demonstrations throughout the country and gathered tremendous amounts of
support that couldn't be silenced by the killing that couldn't be silenced by the government
anymore. And so they came together and ousted a 30-year run, a 30-year dictator.
And since that time, there really were significant democratic gains that had been
commended by international human rights organizations. So, for example, they overturned a
public order that allowed the police to beat women who wore pants. That became overturned.
They also banned female genital mutilation. They ended public flogging. They ended many
things that... really took steps towards democracy. And at the end of their time, in the 2019
revolution, they called for democracy. And what was then enacted was a transitional
government. So, this transitional government consisted of civilians, a civilian group. and a
military component and a military partnership.
That unfortunately brings us to 2021, where the military again ceased power through a
coup. So rather than allowing them a peaceful transition through the transitional government
where the military worked alongside the civilian group. The military took over, again, through a
coup in 2021. And this military coup was led by al-Burhan, the same person who is now one of
the key figures that is responsible for the infighting. The general, the head general of the Sudan
Armed Forces. And so, during this coup, the government officials detained, they arrested. And
they took over people who were part of the transitional council and the transitional council was
dissolved. Civilians who refuse to cooperate, who refuse to take part in this, ultimately, again,
were killed. This is sort of the history of the country that any form of protest gets immediately
silenced through violence and through killing.
And that, unfortunately, brings us to where we are today, 2023, and the humanitarian crisis
that we are facing currently. We're in these two groups in a power struggle have led to infighting
and have put civilians in the middle of their fighting.
There have been many, many calls for ceasefires, and there have been agreements to
ceasefires, really recognized by these two groups. However, none of them have actually come
to fruition, although they say, “Yes, we agree to a ceasefire.” The violence is ongoing and it
continues. This continued through Eid, a Muslim holiday that marks the end of Ramadan, that is
hugely important and vastly important to many people in the country as the majority of the
country is Muslim. And still, there was no regard for this celebration. It has caused the

evacuation of American citizens in Sudan. So the U. S. actually took quite a long time, about
two weeks, to evacuate American citizens and diplomats from Sudan, and many people were
left feeling quite helpless and hopeless during that time. And that's compared to other European
nations who evacuated people within the course of three days. And not only were people there
evacuated, but hundreds of thousands of other people in Sudan have been displaced from their
homes. They've taken extremely challenging journeys to get to neighboring countries, like
Egypt, Chad, and South Sudan, that already themselves are under humanitarian strain, and so
you can imagine the strain that has been happening on all these countries, and how this has
turned a bad situation into something that is really potentially extremely volatile.
The only kind of hope is that on May 12th, they started peace talks between the Sudanese
armed forces and the Rapid Support Forces, where they are now gathered in Saudi Arabia, and
signed an agreement to allow safe passage for people leaving battle zones and protect relief
workers and to not use civilians anymore as human shields. But at that time, there was no
ceasefire agreement. And although people are cautiously optimistic. I think we've seen that it
really can't be trusted any of the things that these people say because even amidst all these
other times that they've agreed to ceasefires, neither party has actually stopped firing and either
and both parties blame the other one saying “We agree to a ceasefire, but the other party
hasn't.” And so that's really left people in kind of a hopeless situation and it's hard to kind of
think about a way out. And not only has this had many effects on all the people there, but it's
really had tremendous effects on the healthcare system.
And so I want to transition just to talking a little bit about the health care system in my
capacity as a health care worker. And I'm sure many of you coming to this talk also have a
health care background. So I want to talk a little bit about the healthcare system. Before I talk
about the healthcare system, I just want to pause here and see if anybody has any thoughts,
questions, or reflections on what I've shared so far about the history.
I see someone has their hand. Go ahead, Sohil.

Sohil Sud
Hi, Salma. Thanks so much for sharing. Really appreciate you. Being here, educating all of
this, and you know, particularly talking about the personal connections and the love you have for
the country. On that broader overview, my question, I suppose, is on the politics. Given just what
you've described, it sounds like both factions potentially are really just not supported by the
people, right? So I guess I'm curious if you have a sense, either from you know, your readings

or from your conversations, if you have a sense of what desire as an ultimate outcome, of
course, peace is, you know, foremost, but beyond that, is there a structure which is generally
supported?

Salma Dali
Yeah, that's a great question. You're absolutely right that the majority of Sydney's people
don't support either party and they actually don't want military involvement at all to play a part in
the government. A political structure that has been largely ruled by the government, excuse me,
largely ruled by military forces. And that's not what the people want. They really want a
transition to democracy.
I think it's a little bit challenging to envision how exactly that transition to democracy will
happen, because in the past when they have advocated for a democratic transition through a
civilian-led process. The military is really reluctant to relinquish control. And so in an effort to
kind of guide the country out of this military leadership into a more civilian-led government, there
have been attempts to work both groups alongside one another, the civilians in one group and
then the military in another group working together. But we've seen time and time again that the
military and uses their power to just have these coups and take over again and again. I think for
the large part, though, the Sudanese people, really the calls are for democracy.

Sohil Sud
Thank you.

Salma Dali
Yeah. Other thoughts or questions?
And we'll talk a little bit more about kind of what the needs and goals are too after this.
So thinking a little bit about the healthcare system and structure, of course, there's been,
you can imagine a really large impact on the healthcare structure there. And these groups have
actually targeted the healthcare structure as one of their main ways of enacting their control. So,
they've done things like seizing ambulances, targeting hospitals, and targeting doctors who are
trying to help people who've been injured in the fight. They have destroyed some of these
hospitals, doing targeted bombings and attacks. And that's led 70% of the hospitals to shut
down, including the main children's hospital.

I just want people to think about that for a second and take that in. Comparing that to, in my
recent memory, was even when there are like strikes here that happen regionally in the Bay
Area at one hospital, there are these massive alerts that happen and all these systems in place
to sort of help offload. And imagine a structure in which a hospital here doesn't even completely
shut down and already we have all these systems in place. But if you're only operating at 30%
capacity, where does that leave these people who already have such limited access to medical
care? They already have such limited access to dialysis and medications and now it's gone from
hardly any to essentially none. People don't have dialysis that they need. They don't have
medications. They're running out of blood transfusions that are hugely important at a time when
there is so much violence and so many of these people are being attacked.
And thank you for adding, Sara, too, that there's virtually no access to insulin in Sudan,
which is really frightening for a lot of diabetic elders. Yeah, exactly.
I want to share this quote that I found really powerful from a Sudanese physician. Who was
working on the ground in Sudan and said, “I'll never forget that lifeless body I saw stretched
across the entrance of the medical facility. We tried to pull him in, but the shelling was relentless
and RSF vehicles were roaming the streets.” So you can just imagine the trauma that the
people are experiencing and the work that these Sudanese doctors are really doing their best to
be able to help, operating in really limited capacity. And I think that includes things. The
examples that I heard of recently are: a two-year-old who was diagnosed with a brain tumor that
they found after he had had signs of increased intracranial pressure; and they found a really
massive space-occupying lesion, and is unable to get the necessary resection that he needs
because he's essentially stuck in Sudan without access to care. A five-year-old who already had
had seizures and, in this period, presented with increased seizures and hearing the calls from
her parents, who really are just at their wit's end and don't have any access, and are uncertain
what to do. And as Sara alluded to, thinking about my own aunt who has insulin-dependent
diabetes, and there's essentially no access to insulin. And although they stocked up and are
storing some insulin in the fridge. The country has been faced by really frequent power outages.
And so even the insulin that she has had and has stocked up on, she's not able to really use
because there's no power to keep it stored appropriately. So, these are just some of the stories
of what the people are facing.
And I don't want it to be such an image of only this hopelessness and helplessness. There
are many people like us who are capable, and as physicians, we can use our power and our

advocacy to help change the situation. So there are really two main groups, American-based
groups that I'll talk about. I'm sure that there are many others, but since we're here in the U. S., I
want to talk about two main groups. One of whom being the Sudanese American Medical
Association and the other being the Sudanese American Physician Association, and both of
these groups work directly in Sudan in different regions. And so, I want to share some of the
work that they're doing to kind of paint a little bit of a more hopeful picture and to kind of talk
about some of the ways forward.
So, the Sudanese American Medical Association just yesterday released this interim
humanitarian crisis report, and it shows, this is just one example of a timeline in one of the
hospitals, but you can see it shows step-by-step all the actions that they've taken. In different
regions in Sudan. So, this one is an example where they are operating and working directly
with. An OBGYN society in Sudan and the Association of Pediatricians have released funds to a
health center there and that they have used these funds to really be able to kind of support the
hospitals that already exist locally. And this is just one example of one of the hospitals that
they've used, and they've released a really extensive report of the way that they are fundraising
and the way that they're supporting hospitals already in operation on the ground to help bolster
their resources.
The Sudanese American Physician Association, I know there's a lot on this slide, but I think
that just goes to show the really incredible work that they're doing there. have had a sort of a
two-pronged approach. One is acute emergency care and the other is supporting internally
displaced persons. So in terms of the acute emergency care, they have started off, they've
operated two different hospitals, one of them is in Omdurman, which is right outside the capital,
and have so far been able to I'm assisting the treatment of over 100 children. They also have
supported operations in a Saudi hospital, which again provides OBGYN and pediatric services.
And they collaborate directly with the Sudanese Doctors Union, who works directly on the
ground in Sudan, as well as in South Darfur, the Ministry of Health working there.
And then, as I mentioned, over 100,000 people have been displaced internally. And so they
really are working to create a new medical office in one of the states where many of the
displaced people have gone. They are working to provide primary care and they also are
working to provide mobile clinics to be able to meet these displaced people where they're at in
their camps and then providing emergency services to people who've been transferred. I'll say
something else that's not on this slide that I know that is happening and that I'm a part of as well

is that they have actually employed physicians who are outside of Sudan to operate this really
expansive telemedicine network so that anybody who's in Sudan or people who've been
displaced or people who previously maybe had access to care but are now not getting as much
access as people really focus their efforts to treating war victims. That they've created this
network whereby people can access medical care through telemedicine and they've created a
platform for people to get assistance from physicians who are outside of Sudan, so American
physicians and elsewhere, to be able to call these folks and create a telemedicine kind of
service, as one other way to provide care.
That's kind of the healthcare system, sort of the structure of what's been going on and the
ways that people can help. And I really want to highlight, through the Sudanese American
Medical Association and the American Physicians Union, the spirit of the Sudanese people, the
same spirit that we saw in 2019, the way that people stood together and really rose up in a
peaceful way to kind of call for what they wanted. That really, to me, is the spirit of Sudan. It’s
this incredible resilience that, despite years and years of violence, years and years of being
under dictatorships and under violent rule. That the heart of Sudan stems from really people
who are resilient, people who want good, people who want to help other people. And I think that
we see that in the efforts of a lot of these organizations that are really Sudanese led. And so that
is kind of the narrative that I think is really important and one that's not often shown, but to me,
that's kind of the more important thing because it's not just, although it's presented sort of as the
minority of people who are responsible for all the violence, the majority of the people really want
peace.
So that brings us to some of these steps for action. And to me, there are sort of three main
areas of action. There's education, advocacy, and donation. And before we talk about any of
those, I just want to talk about some of the current and future needs. I think Sohil had asked a
little bit about this, about what are the goals of the Sudanese people? What are some of the
needs and wants?
I think first and foremost, understandably, in a time when so many people are still being
killed and there's still so much violence. The main ask is just for peace. People really want a
ceasefire. They want peace. They want all the violence to end. They don't want people, innocent
civilians losing their lives, afraid to leave their homes, being displaced. They really want to
return to peace at the very, very minimum.

The other thing that's being called for is accountability via channels like the International
Criminal Court, amongst others. I mentioned that this is the group that where Omar al-Bashir
was tried for some of his war crimes. But I think we've seen, historically, time and time again,
that there's really no accountability for any of these players who are enacting all of these war
crimes. And without that, this will inevitably continue.
Despite the U.S. and other kinds of global powers saying. If you do this, then we will do this.
There's really no follow through on any of the actions. And so, I think that sends a message to
these generals that there is really no consequence for any of their actions. And they'll carry on
saying that they agreed to a ceasefire qnd actually not doing a ceasefire, recognizing that there
are no consequences. So, people really want these people to be held accountable.
The other thing is international aid and response. Like I mentioned, there has been sort of, I
think, a slow and lackluster response. People have felt that they've lost a lot of faith in some of
the international community, particularly in the Western community, particularly in the United
States, and that they've been a really slow response initially to even evacuate American citizens
who are living in Sudan. And then beyond that, kind of being slow to recognize the development
of this conflict. A lot of people, I think, felt caught off guard. But if you take a look back in history,
you could see how this would unfold. And a lot of people in Sudan really weren't surprised by
this at all. My own family members, who used to live in Khartoum. I remember talking to them
and saying, “Wow, I'm so grateful that you guys were able to get out.” How coincidental, how
lucky that you got out just before all of this started. And they said, “No, of course it wasn't
coincidental. It was very purposeful. We knew that this was ultimately going to happen. There
was no support from the international community. There were no calls. There was no
accountability taken.” And so, rather than having more support back in 2019, back in 2021,
when there was really prime opportunity to be able to transition peacefully to a democratic
government. None of that was really present, and that's sort of what's led to where we are today.
There's also now an open letter to ask Egypt to support those fleeing violence in Sudan. I
think Egypt, just given its geographic location, has seen a lot of the displaced persons from
Sudan and so a lot of the people in Sudan have fled to Egypt. And of course, then that really
needs a lot of support from Egypt to be able to take on these refugees and be able to provide
support. And so, there's an open letter and that's one of the asks too.
And then another ask is civilian involvement in these decisions. I mentioned that there right
now are a peace talks that are happening in Saudi Arabia. But notably the people who are

missing at the table are the civilians. Many of these people. Many of the times in the past when
there have been discussions, political decisions, understandably have really focused on the
generals since they're the ones who are in charge and carrying out a lot of these violent crimes.
But that really leaves out an important voice and not only an important voice but a majority
voice, the civilians who want democracy, the civilians who have been the ones who called for
revolution who have been trying to shift the way in which Sudan is governed are often left out of
a lot of these decisions. And then that results in sort of these discussions, without a majority of
the people being involved.
And then the ultimate goal, of course, is a transition to democracy. Really hard to know, in
the current state right now, when there's so much else to focus on. Just really asking for people
to not be killed anymore, it's hard to envision. A world in which democracy is able to be realized,
but that's the ultimate goal. And I think a lot of people are really hopeful that that can still
happen.
So with all those things in mind about the current and future needs, let's talk about some of
the things that we can try to help do in our power.
The first being education. I think this is like one of the cornerstones of why a lot of you are
here today, to educate yourselves, to educate those around you. And that's certainly why I'm
here. Even though I'm Sudanese American, there's still so much more that I can learn. There's
so much more I have been learning about this. And I think that there are really a few main areas
of education. There's sort of like public education on a really large scale. There's a smaller scale
education that still is like effective institutionally, things like this teach-in or other conferences.
There's more local or community-based education where you can talk and discuss with friends
and family. And then there's your individual education where you can stay informed by reading
the news and reliable sources like Al Jazeera, for example, that post pretty regularly about the
conflict in Sudan.
One major form of education that I think we have access to is social media. And I will say
this isn't for everyone. I know, and I'm personally not on social media, but I am a consumer of
social media as are many of us. And so, these are some of the hashtags that are circulating if
people are so moved to be able to educate and raise awareness to a larger, wider audience and
use your platform. Some of them are #Sudanupdates, #keepeyesonSudan, and #notowar. This
Keep Eyes on Sudan hashtag is quite remarkable. They actually have created an entire
website, Keep Eyes on Sudan, that provides updates and offers kind of like opportunities for

people to get involved. And, just it serves as sort of a main platform for people to not forget
about what's going on there, to really keep focused on the situation in Savannah as it unfolds.
So those are some of the educational pieces.
In terms of advocacy, again, I think that there are, really, like large-scale efforts for
advocacy down to even smaller scale, so there's legislative advocacy, there's kind of more local
advocacy in the form of demonstrations, than new and protests, and then there's advocacy in
terms of media, like news sources and things like that.
So in terms of legislative advocacy, I wanted to provide just a sample script, because I think
using our own voices is one of the most powerful things that we can do, and one of the few
things that, when I feel like pretty helpless and feel like I have nothing to offer, I remember that I
have a voice that's powerful and I can use it. And so, calling your representative and saying
something like telling them that you're a constituent in whichever town that you're in, and calling
to voice your concerns about the situation in Sudan. And really calling on them to have
immediate international intervention to be able to maintain or really restore peace. Because if
not, the situation is going to keep continuing, and innocent, defenseless civilians are going to
keep being injured. So, calling your representatives, this is just one sample script, but the Keep
Eyes on Sudan website has many, like, has other sample scripts that you can use and have a
template to either call or to email out to your representatives.
In addition to this, there are other forms of advocacy like the open letter that I mentioned to
Egypt that is also on that same website, the Keep Eyes on Sudan website. And then, of course,
there are things like local protests that you can get involved in. So, there was one just recently
that I took part in in the Bay Area that was right here in San Francisco outside of City Hall,
where many people gathered, Sudanese Americans and allies alike, to call for an end to
violence in Sudan. And this was picked up by KQED to be able to really give more attention to
this more locally. And beyond that too, I think it's, you know, really, there's a lot of opportunity to
proactively reach out to news organizations, to proactively write an op-ed or things of that
nature. And I'm always happy to partner with anybody who wants to join in some of those
efforts.
And then this website, eyesonsudan.net, has upcoming protests that are in any area. It's
really quite incredible. Globally across the entire world, Sudanese Americans and allies are
organizing protests and demonstrations to raise awareness and to call for peace and to ask
their, excuse me, their governments to really make a stand and to get involved. And so, this is a

great source that has not only upcoming protests, but other kinds of you can see here in the
upper left corner. And so that has other areas like donations and other things like that.
And that brings us to donation. I think this is also one of the few things that I feel like is in
my power to do is to donate either my time through volunteering or my money. And I will say, in
my capacity being a Sudanese American, I think I've found some opportunities for volunteering
to be able to donate my time. Luckily, I'm able to speak Arabic and can take part in some of the
things like telemedicine and other things. There are other ways to volunteer as well, even if
you're not Sudanese or you don't speak Arabic, that are maybe a little bit harder to come by,
especially as the conflict unfolds. It's really hard for humanitarian aid organizations to take on
new volunteers at this point. But there are still ways that we can donate our time. By calling our
representatives and using the time and the voices that we do have. And the other thing, of
course, is that we can always donate our resources in the form of making monetary donations.
So in situations like this, I think it's really always important to donate to trusted organizations
that already have a long history of providing humanitarian aid in regions like Sudan. So that's
things like UNICEF and Save the Children that are really known organizations that have been
already working there.
And the other one I'll link here is the Sudanese American Physician Association. That's
where the QR code links, and it's a link directly to a donation site if anybody is interested in
donating. I think it's really clear the incredible work that they've already been doing. But of
course, as we know and see, the resources are quite limited in the area. Any form of donation
can help. I know also sometimes it's challenging for organizations like UCSF to be able to
donate medical supplies. And so, monetary donations are really the thing that's most helpful to
be able to have organizations like the Sudanese American Physician Association be able to
directly purchase the things that they feel like are most in need at that given time.
You can also always go to the Global Disaster Assistance Committee through UCSF. This is
a website that has links to some of these organizations that I've mentioned, donation links, and
also has sort of other areas and other ways that we can act in global disasters and not just for
Sudan, but for many other kinds of violent conflicts and other global disasters that are going on.
So, I think this is a great resource for us in the UCSF community to be able to take part in and
take advantage of.
And so to add SAPA, the Sudanese American Physicians Association has been doing
incredible work accessing areas where NGOs have decided to leave. Likewise, also really

highly recommend supporting to them. I think it's been really incredible being a member myself,
being a new member, seeing some of the incredible work that they've been able to do in the
area. And so that's the kind of message I'd love to leave with. I'd love to open it up for any
questions. And I think the main kind of two things, if I can impart upon people.
The main two things that I want to leave you with are: One, keep eyes on Sudan. Stay
informed, educate yourself, educate those around you, urge your representatives to keep eyes
on Sudan and to really get involved in the situation. And again, that eyes on Sudan website is
an incredible, helpful centralized location where you can find updates, resources, advocacy
locally in terms of demonstrations, ways to get involved in other areas of donation. And then the
other thing is, anything that you're able to donate, if you feel so moved, the Sudanese American
Physician Association has really done some incredible work in the area. And so I'd like to just
leave you all with those things and open it up for any questions, comments, thoughts,
reflections. I know it's not often that we gather in a space like this to discuss, so I'm happy to
hear anything anybody would like to say.
Oh, it looks like Mylo, you've got your hand raised. Go ahead.

Mylo Schaaf
Yeah, I just want to say this has been an incredible presentation and it's so clear and you
present the problems and the solutions so easily for us to follow and take action. So I wanted to
thank you. And also, I know that the material is up on GDAC, and I hope that we can link this to
GDAC as well as to IDHS, what other website it's going to be on, because I think many, many
more people will be interested. And I just heard about this at the last minute, so I think there are
probably a lot of people that want to hear it. So thank you.

Salma Dali
Yeah, thank you. I'm happy to share it with GDAC or anybody else. And I'm happy for any
information that I share here to be circulated. I'm not the owner of this information. I would love
for anybody to use their voices to continue expanding to their networks and communicating this
to anyone.
I think there was a question about embassies and whether or not the embassies have
reopened. I actually am not entirely sure about the embassies, if they've reopened or not. I don't
think so right now. It seems like right now the sort of focus has been on... on evacuating people
from Sudan who are still there, including any diplomats who were there. And so my

understanding right now is that the embassies are still closed. But if anybody has more
information, please feel free to chime in.

Sara Suliman
Maybe I just wanted to add, they're not just still closed. They actually evacuated their
people with Sudanese passports still locked in the embassies and a lot of people have been
trapped in the country because of that, because they applied for visas and couldn't access their
passports after. So it's been frustrating, actually.

Salma Dali
Yeah, to say the least.
Well, thank you all so much for joining and for taking part in this discussion. I want to leave
you all with a message of hope. I would like to really express my sincere gratitude to everyone
for joining this discussion and for really being allies to all the people in Sudan. Thank you all.
