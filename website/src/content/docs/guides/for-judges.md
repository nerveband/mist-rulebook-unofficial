3. **Harsh or unhelpful feedback** - Be constructive and specific
4. **Missing overtime** - Track time carefully

## Handling Issues

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Competitor is late | Note on ballot; follow regional policy |

| Inappropriate content | Stop performance; consult organizers |
| Suspected plagiarism/AI | Note concern; report to organizers |
| Audience disruption | Address or request organizer assistance |

## Feedback Tips

Good feedback is:
- **Specific** - Point to exact moments or elements
- **Balanced** - Include strengths and areas for growth
- **Actionable** - Give suggestions they can apply
- **Encouraging** - Recognize effort and potential

Example:
> "Your thesis was clear and your examples were compelling. For future presentations, try varying your pace more - slowing down on key points would add impact. Strong connection to the theme throughout!"
