## The Flow of Water: Balancing Scarcity, Use, and Waste

This topic explores how human systems like households, agriculture, industry, and public infrastructure interact with water resources, and what happens when access and usage is imbalanced. Using data, reports, and real-world examples, these materials highlight patterns of shortage, overconsumption, and inefficiency around the world.

**Goal:** Consider how decisions surrounding water use affect health, food security, and long-term sustainability across communities.
