## Where The Lines Are Drawn: Housing and the Map of Inequality

This topic examines how decisions about housing shape who has access to stability, opportunity, and security. Through a combination of reporting, human rights frameworks, and economic analysis, the materials examine how housing policies, markets, and systems of governance influence where and how people live.

**Goal:** Consider how boundaries around housing are created, reinforced, and challenged, and what these lines reveal about inequality, belonging, and power within societies.
