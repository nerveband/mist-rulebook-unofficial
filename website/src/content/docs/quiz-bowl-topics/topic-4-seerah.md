## Community, Direction, and Diplomacy in the Seerah

This topic explores key moments in the life of the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) that shaped the early Muslim community. Through the establishment of the first mosques, early khutbahs, the change of the Qiblah, and the Treaty of Hudaybiyya, the materials examine how faith, leadership, and political strategy worked together during a critical period of Islamic history.

**Goal:** Understand how principles of worship, unity, and diplomacy guided the development of the Muslim community in times of both challenge and opportunity.
