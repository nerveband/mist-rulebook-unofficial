The 3D Art competition allows you to express your creativity through three-dimensional sculptural works that reflect this year's theme.

## Format
In-Person

## Submission Requirements

**On-Site:**
- Artwork must be prepared and ready when you arrive at the tournament
- Drop off completed product to the allocated room upon registration
- Written artist statement (3 hard copies, 500 words maximum)
- Pictures of Artwork (JPG, TIFF, or PNG format) from varying angles

## Registration Guidelines

1. No more than **four (4) students** from each school can register.
2. This competition is **NOT** a team effort. Each competitor must turn in a separate piece.
3. MIST ID and order of competition will be pre-assigned on a random selection basis.

## Special 3D Art Rules

The 3D Art competition follows the same rules as 2D Art, with these additional requirements:

<Steps>

1. All submissions must be **three-dimensional**.

2. Artwork should be placed on a **board** for easy carrying (any sturdy material).

3. 3D art should be **sturdy** — judges look for well-constructed work that can handle multiple moves.

4. **3D printing is NOT permitted** for any aspect of the submission.
   - Usage is grounds for elimination.

5. Students **MUST** include pictures of their work at multiple points of the planning and creation process.

6. There is **no size limitation** as long as it can be safely carried to the venue.

</Steps>

## Checklist

- [ ] 3D Art submission
- [ ] Written statement based on interview questions (Section D of Art Ballot)

</Aside>

## Interview Questions

Judges will ask the following questions:

1. How did you aim to convey this year's theme in your work? In what ways does your artwork represent your individual point of view, imagination, creativity, and individuality?
2. Explain your purpose in developing this artwork and describe how you achieved that goal. Describe any influences from art history, artists, or art periods or styles that contributed.
3. What elements or principles of art did you use, and how did you select and organize the visual aspects of this work?
