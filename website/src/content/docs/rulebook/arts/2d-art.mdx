   - Suggestion: Draw a general picture of a squirrel; do not draw a detailed image of the adorable facial expressions when it comes across a good acorn.

2. Students are **NOT** permitted to utilize AI Generators.
   - Includes but not limited to: Dall-E 2, MidJourney, Nightcafe, Deep Dream, Stable Diffusion

5. Ensure your artwork is **dry** before submitting.

6. All 2D artwork must be placed on a **flat and hard surface** (poster board, matboard, illustration board).
   - Affix artwork with spray glue or tape.
   - Do NOT use staples, paper clips, or seeping glue.
   - Do NOT use cardboard for mounting.
   - Artwork should NOT be rolled or folded.

7. There is **no size limitation** as long as it can be safely carried to the venue.

8. Each participant will be interviewed for **5 minutes** to describe the purpose and inspiration.

9. If there are more than **15 entries**, only the top 15 (based on artwork and written statement) will be interviewed.
   - An open gallery preliminary judging round will take place.
   - Top 15 that advance will have a 5-minute interview with the Judges Panel.

10. A typewritten statement **(500 words max.)** must be included explaining what the artwork is about and what inspired you.

11. Both interview and artwork (with written statement) will be judged according to the Arts Competition Ballot.
