**Format:** In-Person  
**Early Submission:** None

## On-Site Submission Requirements
- Artwork must be prepared and ready when you arrive at the tournament
- Competitors must drop off their completed product to the allocated room upon registration
- Written artist statement (3 hard copies, 500 words maximum)
- Pictures of Artwork (JPG, TIFF, or PNG format) - as many as needed from varying angles

## Registration Guidelines

1. No more than **four (4) students** from each school can register for this competition.
2. This competition is **NOT** a team effort. Each competitor must turn in a separate piece of work.
3. MIST ID and order of competition will be pre-assigned on a random selection basis.

## Additional Rules for 3D Art

The 3D Art competition follows the same rules as 2D Art with these additional requirements:

1. All submissions must be **three-dimensional**.

2. Artwork should be placed on a **board for easy carrying**. The board can be made of any material sturdy enough to carry the artwork.

3. **3D art should be sturdy.** Judges are looking for artwork that is well put together. Your work may be moved around on several occasions and should be robust to handle these multiple moves.

4. **3D printing will NOT be permitted** for any aspect of the submission.
   - Usage of 3D printing is grounds for elimination from the competition.

5. Students **MUST** include pictures of their work at multiple points of the planning and creation process with their art piece along with their written component.

6. There is no limitation to the size of the submission as long as it can be safely carried to the venue.
