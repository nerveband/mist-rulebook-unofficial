## Welcome

*Assalamu Alaikum, peace be upon you*

Every project you craft this year begins with a single small step. A simple idea, a moment of inspiration, or a quiet intention can grow into something meaningful. In MIST, the most impactful creations often start with these small beginnings, shaped by your sincerity and effort.

As you prepare for your competitions, think about the small choices that influence your work: the extra revision you decide to make, the detail you refine, the concept you explore a little deeper. These seemingly minor decisions are what transform an ordinary submission into something thoughtful and powerful. Ask yourself: What values guide the things I create? How does intention elevate my work? How can small improvements done consistently bring out the best in my craft?

Remember that excellence is not about perfection, but about purposeful steps taken with sincerity. Every choice you make, from how you prepare to how you collaborate and how you present yourself, shapes not only your own growth but the overall spirit of this tournament. How will you use your small deeds to foster creativity, character, and community?

Bismillah (In the Name of Allah). We enter this tournament season striving for sincerity, consistency, and the awareness that even the smallest deeds can carry great value. May Allah accept our efforts and allow us to create with clarity and purpose. Ameen.

**Sincerely,**

Hira Khattak

## 2026 Theme: Currents of Consequence

**The Might of Small Deeds**

The butterfly effect reminds us that the smallest actions, good or bad, can set off vast chains of events. A single word, a habit, or a choice that seems insignificant in the moment can ripple outward, shaping people, communities, and even history. Those ripples may flow gently in streams, or surge forward as floods, their final impact unknown. Yet over time, streams cut valleys, rivers carve canyons, and tides reshape entire coastlines. Do our actions have the same effect?

The immense power of a seemingly small act is illustrated in the story of Prophet Musa (peace be upon him) in Surah al-Qasas. His mother's decision to trust in God and cast her infant into the Nile became the tide that turned a tyrant. One small ripple set into motion Musa's upbringing in the Pharaoh's palace, preparing him to one day stand against oppression with truth and conviction.

Just as one decision can lead to unexpected good, the principle of action and consequence also means that negative acts can result in a cascade of devastating effects. Abu Huraira reported that the Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) said, "Verily, when the servant commits a sin, a black mark appears upon his heart. If he abandons the sin, seeks forgiveness, and repents, then his heart will be polished. If he returns to the sin, the blackness will be increased until it overcomes his heart" (Tirmidhi 3334). Careless actions, hurtful words, wasted time, and neglected responsibilities can unearth dangerous sinkholes, but repentance offers a path to pull oneself out.

In today's world of instant gratification, small deeds may feel insignificant, and change may feel too slow. But Islam teaches that transformation is built on consistency, patience, and trust in Al Wakeel, the trustee and disposer of affairs. Surah al-Hud tells how Prophet Nuh (peace be upon him) built his ark while people mocked him. Although each plank hammered seemed meaningless to others, when devastating floods came, those small steps became salvation for humanity. Every prayer, every act of kindness, every contribution to justice is a drop in an ocean of barakah, blessings that endure and multiply over time.

**Reflection Questions:**
- What ripple will you create?
- How do you ensure your actions contribute to positive growth?
- How do you take accountability for your role in a chain of events, when the outcome is positive, and when it is negative?

We encourage you to creatively explore these concepts and more in Regional and National competitions and workshops during MIST 2026. Remember that unique projects displaying creativity and insight will be judged most favorably.
