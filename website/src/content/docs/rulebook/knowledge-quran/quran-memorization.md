## Procedures

1. Students are expected to memorize the portion of the Quran relevant to their level in Arabic and be able to recite from memory fluently.
   - **Hafs** (on the authority of Asim) is the recitation style to be utilized during the tournament.

2. Students may begin with Level 1 material in their first year of competition but may not repeat the same Level in subsequent years.

3. Judges will prompt students by reading a portion of a verse and students will be expected to continue the recitation until motioned to stop.
   - Judging will be based on **three separate passages**. Judges will choose all three passages to be tested on.
   - Passage length will be based on judges' discretion.

4. If the student is unable to continue reciting a passage after 5 seconds of silence, the judge may read a word (or few words) to help the student continue reciting.
   - If the student repeats the verse after being prompted from a judge once and is able to continue reciting without help, no points will be deducted.
   - If the judge reminds the student of the beginning of the current verse, which helps the student to start the verse over and continue reciting, only one point should be deducted.
   - 2 points should be deducted each following time the judge has to remind the student of the next word(s).

5. If the student is unable to continue reciting a passage from memory after three failed attempts, the judge may ask the student to proceed to the next passage, forfeiting the remaining portion of memorization points for that passage.

6. Judges are expected to immediately signal a student after a mistake was made with a pen tap (1 tap for minor mistakes and 2 quick taps for major mistakes) so the mistake is not lost.

7. If the mistake is corrected by the student immediately (within 5 seconds or before continuing with the next verse) without being prompted in any way by the judge, one point is deducted.

8. After allowing time for a student to self-correct, a judge should audibly tap the table to indicate a mistake and allow the student a chance to recite the verse once more.

9. If a mistake is not corrected on the second reading of a verse, a judge may recite the correction.
   - The student may ask the judge for clarification.
   - If the student correctly fixes the mistake by reciting the correction from the judge, three points are deducted.

10. If the competitor is unable to fix the mistake after prompting by the judges, the mistake should be noted on the ballot with 1 point deducted for minor mistakes and 2 points for major mistakes.
    - If the mistake is in pronunciation and not in memorization, the mistake should be ignored if it recurs later so that each type of pronunciation mistake is only penalized once.

11. The maximum score a student can achieve is **96 points**. In case of a tie, the judges may break an up to 5-way tie by adding points in the tie breaker section.
