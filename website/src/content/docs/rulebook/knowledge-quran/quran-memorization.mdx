## Procedure

<Steps>

1. Students are expected to **memorize** the portion of Qur'an relevant to their level in Arabic and recite **from memory fluently**.
   - **Hafs** (on the authority of Asim) is the recitation style to be used.

2. Students may begin with Level 1 in their first year but may **not repeat the same Level** in subsequent years.

3. Judges will **prompt students** by reading a portion of a verse, and students will continue until motioned to stop.
   - Judging based on **three separate passages**
   - Judges choose all three passages
   - Passage length based on judges' discretion

4. If student cannot continue after **5 seconds of silence**, judge may read a word (or few words) to help continue.
   - If student repeats and continues without further help: **no points deducted**
   - If judge reminds beginning of current verse helping student start over: **-1 point**
   - Each following time judge reminds next word(s): **-2 points**

5. If student cannot continue after **three failed attempts**, judge may ask student to proceed to next passage.
   - Remaining memorization points for that passage are forfeited.

6. Judges will **immediately signal** after a mistake with a pen tap:
   - **1 tap** for minor mistakes
   - **2 quick taps** for major mistakes

7. If mistake is **self-corrected within 5 seconds** without prompting: **-1 point**

8. After allowing self-correction time, judge should **audibly tap** to indicate mistake and allow another chance.

9. If mistake not corrected on second reading, judge may recite the correction.
   - Student may ask for clarification
   - If student correctly fixes after judge's correction: **-3 points**

10. If unable to fix after prompting:
    - Minor mistakes: **-1 point**
    - Major mistakes: **-2 points**
    - Pronunciation mistakes (not memorization) only penalized once if recurring

11. **Maximum score: 96 points**
    - In case of tie, judges may break up to 5-way tie using tie-breaker section
