## Tournament Guidelines

1. Competitions will be run as school-based teams.
   - For questions regarding coalition teams, please contact your Regional Headquarters.

2. Only one (1) team will be allowed per school.

3. Competitors will compete with the school they have current and active enrollment.

4. Competitors may only sign up/compete in **one competition per category**.

5. Some competitions may be listed under a virtual format. However, Regional Headquarters may choose to run the competition in another format.
   - However, the format in which it is listed in the rulebook is how the competition will be run during Nationals.

6. Many competitions have changed in either how they are run, when they are submitted, or how many competitors may sign up per team.
   - [Prepared Essay](/rulebook/writing-oratory/prepared-essay/), [Poetry](/rulebook/writing-oratory/poetry/), and [Short Fiction](/rulebook/writing-oratory/short-fiction/) will now be run as their own competitions. They will no longer run under Creative Writing.
   - Graphic Design has now been renamed to [Digital Art](/rulebook/arts/digital-art/).
   - All other changes are outlined on the main MIST website and in [What's New in 2026](/changes/2026/).

7. Students registered in a sport or e-sport **MUST** register for another non-sport competition.

8. Failure to attend a registered competition will result in disqualification from any and all sports/e-sports competitions and point deductions per team member.
   - Per team member, it will be a **5 point deduction** from a school's overall score rankings.

## Audience Guidelines

1. **Arrive on time or a little early.**
   - If you arrive late, you will not be allowed entry into the room.
   - Additionally, once inside the room, you will not be allowed to exit.

2. Sit quietly and attentively.

3. No audience members (whether coaches, parents, or others) are allowed to speak to the competitors during rounds.
   - Please hold your comments and questions until a judge announces the conclusion of a round.

4. No talking or loud whispering during the competition.

5. If organizers suspect an audience member is communicating answers or clues to competitors, they will be asked to leave the room.
   - This is also grounds for disqualification.

6. Remain seated during the competition (i.e. no walking about).

7. No whistling, yelling, or other loud methods of congratulations should be done until after the question is answered or the round is completed.
   - If a competitor is focused and ready, but becomes distracted, it can really throw off his/her performance.

8. **Turn off cell phones and other electronic devices.**
   - No photography and/or filming.

9. Parents, coaches, and other supporters are more than welcome to attend [MIST Quiz Bowl](/rulebook/brackets/quiz-bowl/).
