## Competitor Guidelines

1. **Competitors are responsible for being prompt** at registration and their competition times. Failure to be on time may result in losing the chance to compete.

2. MIST name badges and/or identification bands must be worn at all times. If a replacement is needed, see a MIST Representative immediately.

3. **Be prompt in attending all workshops.** Competitors and their teams receive spirit points for attending the workshops they've chosen.
   - Failure to appear at these workshops will cause the team to lose spirit points.
   - Students must stay until the end of each workshop in order to be counted present.

4. Each team **MUST** be accompanied by at least one coach.
   - A coach can be a parent, a teacher, an administrator, or a sibling, or any trusted adult older than 21 years of age.
   - At least one coach MUST be at the tournament with their team at all times and never leave the campus.
   - If a coach has to leave, they must have a replacement.
   - Please plan ahead and make sure the coach who will be accompanying your team is registered through MyMIST.

5. MIST participants may not leave the tournament venue without a registered coach from their own team or without the MIST Board's permission.

6. **No student is allowed to leave the tournament early** on any day. All teams/students must arrive on time and leave only when the tournament is over.
   - If there is an important reason for a student to leave early, they must let MIST know no less than **seven (7) days** in advance.
   - To obtain permission to leave early, contact your Regional Registration Headquarters.
   - We reserve the right to allow/refuse a student from leaving early.
   - Once MIST gives the student permission to leave early, they MUST let the team coach know that they are leaving and when they will return.

7. Your region will use a variety of methods to connect with and contact you. These include, but are not limited to: Email, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, the GetMistified app, Slack and/or Discord.
   - Failure to read updates being sent will be on the competitor, not on the region.

8. Students who spectate must abide by gender segregation guidelines that have been set.
   - Ex. Brothers are not permitted to spectate Sisters [Improv](/rulebook/brackets/improv/), [Nasheed](/rulebook/group-projects/nasheed-rap/) and [Quran](/rulebook/knowledge-quran/). The same rules apply for Sister spectators.

9. **Read the program and competition rules carefully.** Participants are required to follow the rules published in the Annual Competitions Rulebook published at www.getmistified.com. If you don't know, ASK!

10. Share ideas with others, help each other solve problems, make connections, and **HAVE FUN!**
