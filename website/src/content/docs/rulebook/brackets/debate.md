## Registration Guidelines

1. A maximum of **two (2) students** from each team may register, with no substitutions.
2. This is a **team effort**, but students may also register solo.
   - If solo, students must fill both roles for their team.

## Tournament Structure

Parliamentary Debate is a **Bracket Competition** (elimination format):
- Two rounds of Preliminaries
- Quarterfinal Round (top 8 teams)
- Semifinal Round (top 4 teams)
- Final Round

:::note
If an odd number of teams are present at the first preliminary round, even-numbered pairs will be made with a randomized odd team sitting out Round 1 and competing in Round 2. All teams advance to Round 2 regardless of Round 1 results.

## Scoring System

Debate follows a **win versus loss structure** (not points-based).

### Tie-Breaking (for same win-loss ratio)

1. **Opponent Strength Score**: Measured by win-loss ratios of opponents to prevent easy schedule biases.
   - Example: A 1-1 team that beat a 2-0 team ranks higher than a 1-1 team that beat a 0-2 team.

2. **Speaker Rankings**: Judges rank speakers 1-4 on speaking ability.
   - For solo competitors, rankings apply to both roles separately.

## Roles and Terminology

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Speaker** | The moderator of the debate |
| **Government** | The affirmative side |
| **Opposition** | The negative side |
| **House** | Participants and audience collectively |

Debaters must address themselves to "Mr. [or Madam] Speaker" at the outset of speeches.
