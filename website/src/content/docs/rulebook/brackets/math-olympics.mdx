### Competition Layout

<Steps>

1. **Pretest**: 30 questions covering Geometry and Algebra, 1 hour duration.

2. **Ciphering Round I**: 10 questions, 2 minutes each.
   - Correct answer = 1 point
   - Speed bonuses: 1st correct = +4 pts (total 5), 2nd = +3, 3rd = +2, 4th = +1
   - Only one answer submission allowed

3. **Ciphering Round II**: 10 questions, 2 minutes each (same scoring).

4. **Ciphering Bonus Round**: Only if two or more competitors tie after Round II.

</Steps>

### Advancement
- Top 10 from Pretest → Ciphering Round I
- Top 5 from Ciphering I → Ciphering Round II

## Procedure

<Steps>

1. No knowledge of **Calculus** is required. Understanding of Geometry, Trigonometry, Algebra I & II, and Statistics & Probability is sufficient.

2. **Basic scientific calculators** are allowed. Graphing calculators (TI-83 or higher) are **NOT** allowed.

3. Students receive a set of problems in different rounds. Highest points advance.

4. No ballot is provided — scoring is based solely on test performance.
