1. **Arrive on time or a little early.**
   - If you arrive late, you will not be allowed entry into the room.
   - Additionally, once inside the room, you will not be allowed to exit.

2. Sit quietly and attentively.

3. No audience members (whether coaches, parents, or others) are allowed to speak to the competitors during rounds.
   - Please hold your comments and questions until a judge announces the conclusion of a round.

4. No talking or loud whispering during the competition.

5. If organizers suspect an audience member is communicating answers or clues to competitors, they will be asked to leave the room.
   - This is also grounds for disqualification.

6. Remain seated during the competition (i.e. no walking about).

7. No whistling, yelling, or other loud methods of congratulations should be done until after the question is answered or the round is completed.
   - If a competitor is focused and ready, but becomes distracted, it can really throw off his/her performance.

8. **Turn off cell phones and other electronic devices.**
   - No photography and/or filming.

9. Parents, coaches, and other supporters are more than welcome to attend [MIST Quiz Bowl](/rulebook/brackets/quiz-bowl/).
   - Please check with your Regional Headquarters to confirm.
