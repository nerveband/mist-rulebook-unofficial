# MIST Quiz Bowl Topic 1:
## The Flow of Water: Balancing Scarcity, Use, and Waste

For MIST Quiz Bowl Topic 1: The Flow of Water: Balancing Scarcity, Use, and
Waste, we encourage students to explore how human systems like households,
agriculture, industry, and public infrastructure, and what happens when the access and
usage is imbalanced. Using data, reports, and real-world examples, these materials
highlight patterns of shortage, overconsumption, and inefficiency around the world. Our
goal for this topic is to encourage students to consider how decisions surrounding water
use affect health, food security, and long-term sustainability across communities.

Questions will be asked from the following:
- How AI Uses Our Drinking Water - BBC World Service
- Water Scarcity - World Wildlife Fund (WWF)
- Drinking Water - World Health Organization (WHO)
- Water Scarcity in Agriculture: The Greatest Threat to Global Food Security - University of Tennessee
- The United Nations World Water Development Report 2024 Water for Prosperity and Peace
- The United Nations World Water Development Report 2024 Water for Prosperity and Peace Facts Figures and Action Examples

How AI uses our drinking water - BBC World Service

BBC Narrator
One-fifteenth of a teaspoon. That's how much water the average single interaction with
ChatGPT uses. According to Sam Altman, the boss, of OpenAI. So if you type, “Can you help
me solve this maths problem?” That's a drop. Or “can I put lime instead of lemon in this recipe?”
That's a drop. Or “why is the sky blue? Help me write this email. Help me improve my website
code.”
Mr. Altman claims there are 1 billion messages sent to ChatGPT every day. And ChatGPT
is just one AI bot. Chuck in Gemini, DeepSeek, Claude, and others. It's clear that the AI
revolution is a thirsty one. Striking though it is, some experts are more than a little skeptical of
Sam Altman's estimate on water usage.

Professor Shaolei Ren
At this point, there was just not enough information for me to agree with or trust the number.
Their number was perhaps referring to some tiny models. We're considering a medium-sized,
large-language model. That's the size of GPT-3. Basically, if you write an email or ask some
questions, if you have 10 to 50 queries, you're going to be consuming roughly 500 milliliters of
water.

BBC Narrator
This calculation includes water used in cooling and electricity generation. The BBC asked
OpenAI for more details about Sam Altman's estimate, but the company declined. Either way,
it's clear. AI uses a lot of water. But why?
Every time you send a prompt to an AI, it has to run complex calculations to understand and
respond. This work is done by the most powerful and specialized computer chips in the world,
housed inside enormous data centers. Even before users can send prompts, the training
process for the models uses the chips to carry out intense work. And all that extra power means

the hardware can overheat and become damaged if not cooled properly. Most data centers use
air cooling systems, which was fine until AI came along.

Abhijit Dubey
But now, because these data centers and the infrastructure that's going in are so much
more energy intensive, there are liquid cooling approaches that are now being implemented.

BBC Narrator
For liquid cooling, the water must be clean to prevent bacteria growing or clogs and
corrosion in the system, which means using mostly drinking water. Here's how the most
common liquid cooling process works. It begins by piping coolant over the processing chips
within the servers. This cooling liquid absorbs the heat and takes it away from the electrics to a
heat exchange unit.

BBC Narrator
Water is used to reduce the temperature of the coolant. The coolant then recirculates back
to cool the servers. Meanwhile, the now hot water is piped to cooling towers, where a
combination of fans and water vapor dissipate the heat, cooling the water. Some of the water
evaporates in that process, while the rest is recirculated through the cooling process several
times before being discharged back into the nearby water source. Overall, up to 80% of the
water evaporates.

Lorena Jaume-Palasí
What it means is that this type of water is gone and that we are extracting water from a
water circuit that is necessary for irrigation, for human consumption, and hygiene.

BBC Narrator
Communities around the world concerned about data centers putting stress on water
sources and electricity grids are pushing back. Protests have been held in Spain, India, Chile,
Uruguay, and parts of the US. And it's not just the operations within the data center that need
water. Generating the electricity to run them requires a lot of water too, because power plants
like coal, gas, and nuclear heat water to create steam, which drives a turbine. The International
Energy Agency has said electricity demand for AI-optimized data centers is expected to

increase by 400% by 2030 to 300 terawatt hours. That's roughly the electricity consumption of
the whole of the UK for a year.
And aside from electricity, water is also needed when manufacturing the semiconductor
chips used to run AI.

Lorena Jaume-Palasí
So water is both used directly and indirectly in the whole supply and creation chain of AI
technologies. It is used for the refinement of the critical raw materials that are needed to create
the hardware of AI.

BBC Narrator
Getting accurate figures on how much water it takes to build AI systems and run them is
difficult. Google, Meta, and Microsoft release annual figures showing that their data centers use
billions of liters of water every year from local sources, but none of them indicate how much.
Much of it is due to AI. Most tech giants recognize the impact it's having. Many, including
Google, Microsoft, and Meta, have pledged to be water neutral by 2030.

Thomas Davin
We hope that can happen, that there is a long way to go to get to those kind of numbers.
Part of what we hope to see is, across the industry, a range of innovations that allow us to
maybe minimize the use of water.

BBC Narrator
Companies are trialing, for example, ways to cool data centers without evaporating any
water at all. and to use the heat that's generated to warm homes. There are also experiments to
move data centers away from communities entirely, under the sea, to the Arctic. or even off the
planet.

Abhijit Dubey
Can we actually put capacity open space? It's very very early stage, so what you know we
at NTT are looking at is: can we launch satellites that can at least do some more
backup-oriented or other-oriented tasks?

BBC Narrator
Though skeptics point to the many hurdles that need to be overcome, there is optimism too,
about a more sustainable future.

Thomas Davin
Let's remember that that Gen AI capability is still very very young; it's moved exponentially
fast, but as an industry and as a use, it is still young. Ideally, we can learn together, as a society
and as a world society, how do we minimize against the use of water and energy? Because this
is all, you know, a world resource when we talk about water.
